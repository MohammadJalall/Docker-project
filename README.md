1. Set Up the Local Development Environment:
Install and configure GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Docker Hub.
Generate SSH key pairs and add the public key to GitHub for secure access.
2. Build AWS Infrastructure:
Create a Three-Tier VPC to ensure secure networking.
Set up a NAT Gateway to allow private instances to access the internet.
Configure Security Groups to manage inbound and outbound traffic.
Deploy an Amazon RDS instance for database management.
3. Containerize the Web Application
Create a repository to store the application code.
Develop a Dockerfile to containerize the dynamic web application.
Implement build arguments and environment variables for flexibility.
4. Push the Docker Image to Amazon ECR
Build the Docker image locally.
Authenticate with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
Push the containerized application to the ECR repository.
5. Deploy the Application on AWS ECS
Use Flyway to migrate data to Amazon RDS.
Set up AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) to run the containerized application.
Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for efficient traffic distribution.
Register an SSL Certificate for secure HTTPS access.
Create a DNS Record in Route 53 to map the domain to the application.
6. Final Deployment & Testing
Verify that the web application is fully functional.
Perform security and performance testing.
Monitor logs and metrics for optimization.
This structured approach ensures a scalable, secure, and fully functional deployment on AWS
